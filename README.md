# Data-Structures-Supplementary-Materials
C implementations of Data Structure Course that help students while they are taking the course, reading README.md first will be helpful about using this material
//SIGNIFICANT PART:
If you haven't taken discrete mathematics course yet, you should check the text documents which explain such as traversal, BFS&DFS, or Dijkstra algorithm. 
Also the pictures in the repo will help you to visualize the structure and will help you while you are coding, it's recommended to look them.
