Sentinel Nodes are the header and tailer (for doubly linked list) which not include any data (dummy nodes)
In C implementation they can be represented as:
list->header->next=list->head;
list->tailer->prev=list->tail;
They don't represent any data and this structure can be used as this form.
For example:
list->header->next=node;
(The "node" can be thought as head element that we used as before)
They are out of element.
